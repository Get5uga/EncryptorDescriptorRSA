# EncryptorDescriptorRSA
RSA. The project contains methods: generation of public and private keys, encryption and decryption.

P.S. in class Main contain variable "str", it can only have the value of those characters in the acl table that occupy a position below 256 characters. In other cases, you need to make changes to the code (class GenerationKeys.java)

P.P.S this is my first application after "Hello World" in Java, please take this into account

Thanks
